OPEN CLASSIFICATIONS

In 2021, working on Talentli, a merit-based scoring system to search people, I've realized that the system required some built-in classifications. Such as a classification of educational programs, so that you can filter people by study field. Or a classification of industries, so that you can filter people by job field. Or a classification of occupations, so that you can sort & rank people objectively.

After some search on the Internet, I've noticed that many existing classifications are copyrighted. Also, they are made by different organizations and they are not consistent with each other â€“ in numbering & naming of the classes. As a result, I've decided to spend some time and make the standardized open classifications available below, both online and in other formats.
